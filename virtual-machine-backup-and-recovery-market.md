<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Virtual Machine Backup and Recovery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Agent Type</li><li>Agentless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Virtual Machine Backup and Recovery market primarily consists of two types: agent-based and agentless solutions. Agent-based backup solutions involve installing a software agent on each virtual machine, providing granular backup capabilities and optimized resource usage. In contrast, agentless solutions operate from a centralized location, backing up multiple VMs without the need for individual installations. This simplifies management and reduces overhead, making it ideal for environments with a large number of virtual machines. Both types cater to different organizational needs and preferences.</p></p>
