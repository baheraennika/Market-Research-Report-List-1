<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transvenous Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators</li><li>Subcutaneous Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs) market comprises two main types: Transvenous Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators and Subcutaneous Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators. Transvenous ICDs are implanted through the veins, allowing electrodes to be placed directly in the heart, providing effective rhythm monitoring and shock delivery. In contrast, Subcutaneous ICDs are implanted under the skin, with the lead positioned away from the heart, offering a less invasive option while minimizing the risk of infection. Both types aim to prevent life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias.</p></p>
