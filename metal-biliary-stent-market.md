<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metal Biliary Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Covered Metal Biliary Stent</li><li>Uncovered Metal Biliary Stent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The metal biliary stent market comprises two main types: covered and uncovered metal biliary stents. Covered metal biliary stents are designed with a silicone or polymer coating that helps prevent tissue ingrowth, reducing the risk of blockage and extending the stent's patency period. In contrast, uncovered metal biliary stents lack this coating, making them simpler and often easier to place but more susceptible to occlusion due to tissue overgrowth. Both types are utilized to relieve biliary obstruction and maintain bile flow.</p></p>
